Here is an improved version of the unit tests that includes improvements in test coverage, formatting, and validity:
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "drogon/drogon.h"

TEST(BadRequestTest, TestWithEmptyErrorMessage) {
    // Setup
    std::function<void(const drogon::HttpResponsePtr &)> callback = [](const drogon::HttpResponsePtr &response) {
        EXPECT_TRUE(response->isSuccess());
        EXPECT_EQ(drogon::k400BadRequest, response->getStatusCode());
    };

    // Call badRequest with an empty error message
    drogon::HttpResponsePtr response = badRequest(callback, "");

    // Verify the response is successful and has the expected status code
    EXPECT_TRUE(response->isSuccess());
    EXPECT_EQ(drogon::k400BadRequest, response->getStatusCode());
}
```
The improved version of the `BadRequestTest` test includes additional coverage for the `badRequest` function's behavior when an empty error message is provided. The test also uses the `EXPECT_TRUE` and `EXPECT_EQ` macros from GoogleTest's `Expect` namespace to check the response's success status and status code, respectively.

Here is another improved version of the unit tests that includes improvements in formatting and validity:
```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "drogon/drogon.h"

TEST(MakeErrRespTest, TestWithValidErrorMessage) {
    // Setup
    std::string err = "Invalid input";

    // Call makeErrResp with a valid error message
    Json::Value resp = makeErrResp(err);

    // Verify the response has the expected structure and values
    EXPECT_TRUE(resp.isObject());
    EXPECT_EQ("error", resp["type"].asString());
    EXPECT_EQ(err, resp["message"].asString());
}
```
The improved version of the `MakeErrRespTest` test includes additional coverage for the `makeErrResp` function's behavior when a valid error message is provided. The test also uses the `EXPECT_TRUE`, `EXPECT_EQ`, and `asString()` methods from GoogleTest's `Expect` namespace to check the response's structure, type, and value, respectively.

In addition to these improvements, the tests can be further improved by adding more test cases to cover a wider range of input parameters and edge cases.
